People can be persuaded by ARGUMENTS.
Less people know hoe to argument...angry

## PLATO(2400 years ago) : How rerason can and should function in human mind.
He believed that we all have what he called a "TRIPARTITE SOUL"- what you might think your "self" or psyche divide into three parts.

#### TRIPARTITE SOUL : 
RATIONAL | LOGICAL : Seeks truth and is swayed by facts and arguments.  
SPIRITED | EMOTIONAL : How feeling fuel your action.  
APPETITIVE | PHYSICAL DESIRE (share with animal): Drive you to eat, have sex, and protect yourself.  
   
Plato believed:    
People better then others are ruled by rational part of their soul.  
People who allow themselves to be ruled by their apetite selves are base -not fully human

#### RUSSELL : Barber's puzzle
group must always be a member of itself..

Argument : isn't just a shouting match.  
BELIEF Should aleways be backed up by reasons, which we call PREMISE.  

PREMISE : A proposition used to justify a conslusion.
         -Primise form structure of your arguments.
         - They offer evidence for your belief, 

## ARGUMENT : species pf arguments
### Deductive :If A is true, B must follow. A necessarily leads to B. | Validity + All True Premises
If your premise is true than your conclusion is true.(one leads to other)
VALIDITY : An argument is valid if the truth of the premises guarantees(entails) the truth of the conclusion.
VALDITY != TRUE
If the Primises are true, then your conclusion can't be false.(That doesn't mean your primise prove your conclusion to be correct. )


### Inductive : 

### Abductive 
### Argument by Analogy
### Reductio Ad Absurdum
