# What is Philosophy?: Crash Course Philosophy #1

## Origin of Philosophy in Ancient Greece  
Mythos( Storytelling) vs Philos(Science..)   

Philosophia : Love of wisdome  
Philosophy : The Academic study of Anything  

-Math,bio,poliSc,strono were all considered to be philosophy  

-SCIENCE : Studies that had strong empirical elements came to be considered science- A search for answers  
-PHILOSOPHY: came to be more as a way of thinking about questions.

### BIg Question fpor philosophers?
What is the world like?
What is the nature of reality? : Is the world just made up of matter and enery , or is there something else going on? And if it is all matter and energy then where didi it all come from? If god? what is she like?


## Main Division of Philosophy: 
### A. Mataphysics : 
The branch of philosophy that studies the nature of reality
### B. Epistemology : 
Knowing about knowing
The branch of philosophy that studies the nature and scope of knowledge
### C. Value Theory :ETHICS & ASTHETICS 
   C1. ETHICS : How should I behave in society
   The branch of philosophy that studies and evaluate human consuct
   C2: ASTHETICS : What beauty is and what it constitute of? not look goog but has something beyond  
   the branch of philosophy that studies the nature oif beauty.
   
   

## Logic : How to understand & What to understand ?  
- Logic is philosophers toolbox, It contains the saws and hammers th mnicroscope and pickers gthat philosophers uses to answer in systemic ways  
- Logic is about reasoning, giving strong arguments that don't fall victim to fallacies,which are mortal enemy of philosophical pricision.  

FALLACY : A failure in reasoning or flawed reasoning that leads to an invalid or unsound argument.

### To learn about major fiels of philosophy by two steps method  
Step1: Try to understand     
Don't try to agery try to go inside a point- to understanfd as charitbly as possible.   
[PINCIPLE OF CHARITY : Always try to understand the strongest, most persuasive version of an argument.]

Step2: CRITICAL EVALUATION    
Try to knock down what you think about a particular view of world. Do this wether you agree or not.     
Only when you challange your understandoing of how some people view the eorld , can you decide for yourself if theirs is a view woryth having    

GOAL of philosophy is to use your brain to come up with the answers that make the most sense to you.  
Learn how to formulate argument to support your ideas, so you can explain why you think you're right.  


# How to Argue - Philosophical Reasoning: Crash Course Philosophy #2  

## ARISTOTALS: human as the rational animal, 
RATIONALITY is our distingushing characteristic - it's what sets us apart from beasts.  
   
People can be persuaded by ARGUMENTS.
Less people know how to argument...angry
  
-Learning about arguments and strong reasonoing will not only make you a better philosopher, it'll also set you up to be a more persuasive person.  

## PLATO(2400 years ago) : How rerason can and should function in human mind.
He believed that we all have what he called a "TRIPARTITE SOUL"- what you might think your "self" or psyche divide into three parts.

#### TRIPARTITE SOUL : Pysche divided in 3 parts
Human is made up of 3 souls
RATIONAL   | LOGICAL : Seeks truth and is swayed by facts and arguments.  
SPIRITED   | EMOTIONAL : How feeling fuel your action.  
APPETITIVE | PHYSICAL DESIRE (share with animal): Drive you to eat, have sex, and protect yourself.  
   
Plato believed:      
People better then others are ruled by rational part of their soul.   
People who allow themselves to be ruled by their apetite selves are base -not fully human  

## Philosphical skills :
We will apply pondering _Puzzles, _Paradoxes , and _ThoughtExperiments.
-Philosphers love thinking about questions specially those not answered by any.

#### BERTRAND RUSSELL : Barber's puzzle
Does the barber shave himself?
group must always be a member of itself..  

Argument : isn't just a shouting match.   
BELIEF Should aleways be backed up by reasons, which we call PREMISE.  

PREMISE : A proposition used to justify a conslusion.  
         -Primise form structure of your arguments.  
         - They offer evidence for your belief,   

  
  
## ARGUMENT : species pf arguments  
### Deductive :If A is true, B must follow. A necessarily leads to B. | Validity + All True Premises
If your premise is true than your conclusion is true.(one leads to other)  
VALIDITY : An argument is valid if the truth of the premises guarantees(entails) the truth of the conclusion.  
VALDITY != TRUE  
If the Primises are true, then your conclusion can't be false.(That doesn't mean your primise prove your conclusion to be correct. )    
-Reason deduction is prized by philosopgers and lot of important kind of thinkers is thsa it's the only kind of argument that can give you a real certainity.  
-But it's limited bvecuse it only works if you are starting with known, true premises,which are hard to come by.  

### Inductive : Using past experience to make future predictions.  
Inductive reasoning relies on the predictibility of nature to reveal that the future is likely to resemble the past.
Eg. Aspirin will cure the headache.
Unlike deductin , where true premises entail true conclusion Inductive premises only mean that the onclusion is likely to be true. inductive argument don't provide you with ceratinity. Instead, they work in  terms of probabilities.
They are useful for more than pridicting what's going to happen.
eg. Therefore, socrates probably had a beard.
  
### Abductive 
SHERLOCK HOLMES : _"When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be truth"_ 
Abduction reason by ruling out possible explainantion until you're left with the most plausible one given the evidence.
like Induction abduction doesn't give us the certainity.  

INTERLOCUTORS   : People participating in a dialogue, debate, or conversation.
COUNTERARGUMANT : An argument presented to oppose or refute another argument.
SOCRATIC METHOD : Learning through a dialectic exchange of ideas, rather than a passive transmission of information.

### Argument by Analogy
### Reductio Ad Absurdum
 
   
# Leonardo DiCaprio & The Nature of Reality: Crash Course Philosophy #4
Actual philosophy: Never take things at face value. You should always be willing to accept that there's more to the world than meets the eye.
Because whatever truth seems obvious today might turn out to be not so true at all.

Most daunting pursuits of Philosophy - Pondering what's really real, as opposed to what you think is real, and how you could ever know the difference.
Roots of WESTERN PHOLOSPHY: Is it possible that my current rwality isn't real at all?

PLATO : 2400 years wrote his famous book _THE REPUBLIC_  
PLATOs Myth of caves...
Prisoner only saw shadow so considered shadow as reality.... friends not heard him...
LAYERS OF REALITY !
Plato wants us to see that we, right now , are prisoners in a cave. Everything in our world is actually a mere shadow of a higher reality.  as they mistook shadowe as real thing.   
Our mistake is thinking that the material objects of the ordinary world are the most real things.  
PLato shaid , the physical world that we think is the most real, is actually a mere shadow of a higher truth(ultimate reality).  

*Doing Philosophy is Hard! (make U uncomfortable)
*Philosophy is also awesome. (can see though things,feel amzed)
  
    
      
 # Cartesian Skepticism - Neo, Meet Rene: Crash Course Philosophy #5     
 RENE Descartes  : 17th century early modern philosophers,scientist & Mathematician.    
 HOw-do-I-know-what-I-know.
 SKEPTIC : A person who _Questions_ whether _Anything_ can be known with _Certainity_.
 RENE said: disbelief anything.(to make sure not holding anything wrong)
 RENE says : _IF he exemined each possible belief carefully, and only accepted those about which there could be no doubt, then he'd know he was only believing true    things.
  
 CARTESIAN SKEPTICISM: He realised that many belief he had was false. 
 
 ## EMPIRICAL BELIEF :Beliefs that we form through the use of our senses.
 Many believe that our senses are real sources of information. If I can see,hear,smell,taste,touch it, I must know it. -> Sense are not aleways true : Dream
 LOCAL DOUBTS : Doubts about a particular sense experience, or some other occurance at a particular point in time.
 GLOBAL DOUBT : The type of doubt that you can't step out of, and thus can't check,is called global doubt.
      
 REDICAL SKEPTICISM : in which we really can't trust any of our belief.     
 _Every thing we believe,every sese experience,every thought,they could all have been put in our minds by the evil genious who created an illusionary world so seamless,we'd haave no way of detecting the illusion._
 
   
 RENE DESCARTES : MEditation on First Philosophy
 His Foundational belief : _COGITO RGO SUM_ : "I think,therfore I am"  : I can doubt anything but I can't doubt I am bare minimum,a mind having thoughts.
 His CLEAR AND DISTINCT IDEA : "God Exist"   
 later said physical world too exist.     
   
# Locke, Berkeley, & Empiricism: Crash Course Philosophy #6
will learn EMPRICISM as a response of SLEPTICISM
Spilit in two different understanding...
### RESPONSE OF SKEPTICISM :- 
1. RATIONALISM : Belief that reason is the most reliable source of knowledge. 
2. EMPIRICISM : Belief that sense-experience is the most reliable source of knowledge.  

Descartes,like Plato long before him,was a lover of reason. He met skeptism with rationalism. 
He believed that most real things in life were ideas.
IDEAS--__Propositions that can be known through pure reason.
     
Induction and ways of scientific method - ways of thinking that tell us about the material world.

 ## PLato vs Aristotle
 Plato was convinced that truth resided in the immaterial world of ideas,while Aristotle's attention was focused firmly on the ground. 

 JOHN LOCKE : Locke believed that we're all born as a blank slate.  All knowledge is obtained through experience. He rejected the concept of innate ideas - the view that we're born pre-loaded with certain informatiojn what's good and what' bad.
 
 __"_we are born knowing nothing, NAd instead ,all our knowledge comes to us through sense data."
 
 One place Lock agreed with Descartes was in the idea that, just beacuse your senses telling you something that doesn't mean you can trust something.

In order to figure out wether the seses accurately reflect the outside world, he introduced a distinction ehat he called the primary and secondary qualities of all things.

PRIMARY QUALITIES : Qualities that physical objects themselves have.  (nothing to do with U or me.just to with object)
Not in our mind (mass,desity,figure,shape,solidity,depth,weight,width,mobility),belongs to thing itself.
SECONDARY QUALITIES : color,taste,smell,sound,texture  
 
__The distinctiuon between primary and secondary qualities explained the disagreements that we all have about our perceptions of the outside world.__

GEORGE BEKELEY : irish philosopher resonated with above,
_There's no such thing as matter. There can't be! instead,there's only Perceptions._  
his version of cogito - __ESSE EST PERCEPI__ _to be is to be perceived_.

Learnt why George Berkeley thinks that distinction ultimately falls apart.


# The Meaning of Knowledge: Crash Course Philosophy #7
 |Know, Believe, Proposition,Justification |    : Philosophers have lucid idea when they use these terms.  
* Is having Knowledge of something the same thing as being....Correct?  
* If you belive something to be true and it is true does it matter if you belief in it is justified?  
* Can you be right about something without really trying?  

Either someone believe or he knows it.
An Assertion :  A linguistic act - either spoken or written - That has a truth value
Truth value : The stateof being either true, or false, or Inderminant.   
Assert eg: cat will pee  
Proposition :The content of your assertion. The underlying meaning of what you're saying. Eg. Tihs is a cat.
Propositional Attitude : Propositional attitude of Belief prsitional attitude of disbelif.

### Knowledge : JUSTIFIED | "TRUE" | BELIEF 
JUSTIFICATION : Evidence, or Other support, for your belief. Eg, _Testimony from expert can be reliable;_first person experience

* You can have a false belief but you can't have false knowledge. 
 
GETTIER CASES : Situations in which one can have Justified True Belief, but Not-Knowledge.

   
   
# Karl Popper, Science, & Pseudoscience: Crash Course Philosophy #8
Mad edifference between Science and Psudo Science.
 Freud and Eisntein both beileved that their predictrion will help to understand Universe.
 * _Freud, concerned with the individual pysche,predicted that our childhood experience would have aheavy bearing on who we grew up to be.
 * Fopper saw about Einstein that Instead of looking backward, and using past data to "predict" the present,he was looking ahead, and predicting future states of affairs.
 * Greek relied on the belief that, _The traditional understanding of the scientific method: to look at the world with a scientific eye is to observe with no preconceived notions.  
 * Pooper believed: _Method like this[freud] that only served to confirm belief were Psudo-Science. And they could be used to prove anything.  
 * But It's only by seeing to disprove Santa's existence that you can demonstarte his unrerality.    
 * When we begin to test a theory, are we looking to confirm it, or to disconfirm it?  
   
 ### Science Disconfirms | Pdudoscience Confirms
Pooper argued
* It's easy to find confirmation of a theory If you're looking for it. Eg. Santa's Existence   
* RISKY PRIDICTION: Confirmation should only counts if it comes with some risky prediction.  
* Every good scientific theory is PROHIBITIVE (it rules things out).  
* _Every false belief we discover is actually good,Because thats gets us that much closer to believeing only true things.  
* The only genuine test of a theory is one that's attempting to falsify it.
* _Irrfeutable theory are not scientific. (if it can't be tested, than your theory doesn't have much value) 
* Scientist : Let your belief to go - Accept the evidence. - Move on  
#### Modern scientific thinking accepted today  TESTABLE | REFUTABLE | FALSIFIABLE
*  Pooper's knowledge was about PROBABILITY(justified in believing whatewerver seems more probable given our current data) & CONTINGENCY(aleways willing to revise our evidence in th elight of our current data) 
*  _ You have to be open to the idea that your belief might be false Because that's the only way that holding onto them can really mean anything.



# Anselm & the Argument for God: Crash Course Philosophy #9
### PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION vs THEOLOGY
They both take god and religion as their subjects.
But theology start by assuming that God exists, and then figures out what follows. Or theology might solve philosophical problem that might arise from belief in God.
Philosophers has Everything on the table and everything need arguments.

##### FAITH : Faith is definitionally unprovable,Which mnakes it from philosophical perspective, not valuable.

### Philosophy of Religion is not:
* Believing whatever your parents taught you.
* The study of bible 
* Religious Anthropology
* Religious Sociology
* Pyschological understanding of our reason for religious belief.

### ANSELM OF CANTERBURY 
-11th century french Monk
-he offered a deductive argument for the existence of God, based on waht he understood to be the nature of God's being,or the definition of god.

### Ontology : Study of being
Ontological argument. 
#### GOD : god is beat possible thing we can imagine. God is by definition thing we can image. No greater can be conceived.
* Two ways something can Exist :
* Something cam exist only in our minds and be strictly imaginary - like santa, or unicorn.
* Or it can exist in our mind but also in reality, like pizza and horses - something that we can imagine, but that's also real. like pizaaa
* _If we define god as the greatest thing that we can comjure up in our minds, the only thing that could possibly be greater tahn him would be... A Real version!
* deductively proved god's existence  prune to error : God realy exist.

#### IMMANUEL KANT : genrman Philospher
* _EXISTENCE is not a PRIDICATE.
* A predicate is something that's said of another object.
* predicate add to the Essence of their Subject, but they can't be used to prove their existence.



# Aquinas & the Cosmological Arguments: Crash Course Philosophy #10
THOMAS AQUINAS : italian theologian and philosopher encontered Anselm argument...

## AQUINS' 5 arguments for the esxistence of God:
1. Argument of motion
2. Argument from Causation
3. Argument from Contingency
4. Argument from Degrees
5. Teleological Argumnet
First 4 are cosmological arguments(they seeks to prove god's existence).

### 1. Argument of motion

### 2. Argument from Causation

It can't go back forever there has to be firat thing . That thing is God.

### 3. Argument from Contingency

### 4. Argument from Degrees

Unmoved movers & Unmoved Causers 
_Aquinas' Cosmological arguments also don't prove that existence of a sentient god.(might be beared or egg)



## Objection to Aquinas view
* Aquinas was wrong in his insistence that there can't be an infinite progress of anything.
* Aquinas takes it as a given that there had to be a starting oint for everything. Wether it's the movement of objects,or causes and effects, or contingent being created.
But it's not clear it is true or why it is true. 
* they are actually self defeating : 
* If they can exist without god being responsible for them, then we don't need to establish things in the first place.
*  None of his argument prove God but you should have counter argument.

# Intelligent Design: Crash Course Philosophy #11
Willian Paley : english christian philosopher
### 5. Teleological Argument : Goal oriented - or purposefull

#### Argument of Anology
A --> B
Cup --> Cup Maker
Watch --> watch Maker
World --> World Maker

Counterargument : 
How why It was : why blind spot? Nipple? No purpose.
* Bodies are purposeful, and from there concludes that th purpose had to have been put there be an intelligent crerator. But another explaination is
* Another explaination for how bodies came to have the complexity and functiuonality they have today, is natural selection and random mutation.
* Who need a watchmaker when we had natural selection.
* _A flawewd world mean a flawed creater.
* RICHARD SWINBURNE :"Even if there's another possible explainantion for the universe,we should go with the explaination that's most likely to be true."
* "IT's simply more probable that God desigened the world,than that it came about through the pure chance of evolutionary processes."
