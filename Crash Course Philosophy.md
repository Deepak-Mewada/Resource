## Logic : How to understand & What to understand ?  
- Logic is philosophers toolbox, It contains the saws and hammers th mnicroscope and pickers gthat philosophers uses to answer in systemic ways  
- Logic is about reasoning, giving strong arguments that don't fall victim to fallacies,which are mortal enemy of philosophical pricision.  

FALLACY : A failure in reasoning or flawed reasoning that leads to an invalid or unsound argument.

### To learn about major fiels of philosophy by two steps method  
Step1: Try to understand     
Don't try to agery try to go inside a point- to understanfd as charitbly as possible.   
[PINCIPLE OF CHARITY : Always try to understand the strongest, most persuasive version of an argument.]

Step2: CRITICAL EVALUATION    
Try to knock down what you think about a particular view of world. Do this wether you agree or not.     
Only when you challange your understandoing of how some people view the eorld , can you decide for yourself if theirs is a view woryth having    

GOAL of philosophy is to use your brain to come up with the answers that make the most sense to you.

# How to Argue - Philosophical Reasoning: Crash Course Philosophy #2  

## ARISTOTALS: human as the rational animal, 
RATIONALITY is our distingushing characteristic - it's what sets us apart from beasts.  
   
People can be persuaded by ARGUMENTS.
Less people know how to argument...angry
  
-Learning about arguments and strong reasonoing will not only make you a better philosopher, it'll also set you up to be a more persuasive person.  

## PLATO(2400 years ago) : How rerason can and should function in human mind.
He believed that we all have what he called a "TRIPARTITE SOUL"- what you might think your "self" or psyche divide into three parts.

#### TRIPARTITE SOUL : Pysche divided in 3 parts
Human is made up of 3 souls
RATIONAL   | LOGICAL : Seeks truth and is swayed by facts and arguments.  
SPIRITED   | EMOTIONAL : How feeling fuel your action.  
APPETITIVE | PHYSICAL DESIRE (share with animal): Drive you to eat, have sex, and protect yourself.  
   
Plato believed:      
People better then others are ruled by rational part of their soul.   
People who allow themselves to be ruled by their apetite selves are base -not fully human  

## Philosphical skills :
We will apply pondering _Puzzles, _Paradoxes , and _ThoughtExperiments.
-Philosphers love thinking about questions specially those not answered by any.

#### BERTRAND RUSSELL : Barber's puzzle
Does the barber shave himself?
group must always be a member of itself..  

Argument : isn't just a shouting match.   
BELIEF Should aleways be backed up by reasons, which we call PREMISE.  

PREMISE : A proposition used to justify a conslusion.  
         -Primise form structure of your arguments.  
         - They offer evidence for your belief,   

  
  
## ARGUMENT : species pf arguments  
### Deductive :If A is true, B must follow. A necessarily leads to B. | Validity + All True Premises
If your premise is true than your conclusion is true.(one leads to other)  
VALIDITY : An argument is valid if the truth of the premises guarantees(entails) the truth of the conclusion.  
VALDITY != TRUE  
If the Primises are true, then your conclusion can't be false.(That doesn't mean your primise prove your conclusion to be correct. )    
-Reason deduction is prized by philosopgers and lot of important kind of thinkers is thsa it's the only kind of argument that can give you a real certainity.  
-But it's limited bvecuse it only works if you are starting with known, true premises,which are hard to come by.  

### Inductive : Using past experience to make future predictions.  
Inductive reasoning relies on the predictibility of nature to reveal that the future is likely to resemble the past.
Eg. Aspirin will cure the headache.
Unlike deductin , where true premises entail true conclusion Inductive premises only mean that the onclusion is likely to be true. inductive argument don't provide you with ceratinity. Instead, they work in  terms of probabilities.
They are useful for more than pridicting what's going to happen.
eg. Therefore, socrates probably had a beard.
  
### Abductive 
SHERLOCK HOLMES : _"When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be truth"_ 
Abduction reason by ruling out possible explainantion until you're left with the most plausible one given the evidence.
like Induction abduction doesn't give us the certainity.  

INTERLOCUTORS   : People participating in a dialogue, debate, or conversation.
COUNTERARGUMANT : An argument presented to oppose or refute another argument.
SOCRATIC METHOD : Learning through a dialectic exchange of ideas, rather than a passive transmission of information.

### Argument by Analogy
### Reductio Ad Absurdum

Actual philosophy: Never take things at face value. You should always be willing to accept that there's more to the world than meets the eye.
Because whatever truth seems obvious today might turn out to be not so true at all.

Most daunting pursuits of Philosophy - Pondering what's really real, as opposed to what you think is real, and how you could ever know the difference.
Roots of WESTERN PHOLOSPHY: Is it possible that my current rwality isn't real at all?

PLATO : 2400 years wrote his famous book _THE REPUBLIC_  
PLATOs Myth of caves...
Prisoner only saw shadow so considered shadow as reality.... friends not heard him...
LAYERS OF REALITY !
Plato wants us to see that we, right now , are prisoners in a cave. Everything in our world is actually a mere shadow of a higher reality.  as they mistook shadowe as real thing.   
Our mistake is thinking that the material objects of the ordinary world are the most real things.  
PLato shaid , the physical world that we think is the most real, is actually a mere shadow of a higher truth.  

*Doing Philosophy is Hard! (make U uncomfortable)
*Philosophy is also awesome. (can see though things,feel amzed)
