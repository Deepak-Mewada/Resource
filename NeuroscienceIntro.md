# Neural Time series Analysis - MX Cohen

## Neuroscience is Source Separation
All mental process are happening together. Signal multiple sourcesso the goal is to separate the multiple sources.

## How can source be separated?
-Anatomical Source Separation : based on anatomy,just study one part of the brain based on anatomy

-Cognititve Source Separation : clever experiment to isolate a single cognitive source like short term mempory

-Temporal Source Separation :

-Spatial Source Separation :

-Statical Source Separation: Using Statistical charecterastic of the data to perfrom this source separation.   
        Not the inferential statistics i.e p-value or F-value but descriptive statistics i.e variance,covariance,spectral features.  
        Statisctical source separation that leads to temporal or spectral and spatial source separation.  
        Statistical source separation is all about applying filters to the data.  
        
        
  ## Source separation via Filtering
        -Temporal Filtering :OrigionalSignal*Kernel=Filtered Signal - over time for one channel
        -Spatial Filtering : W<sup>t *X over space for all channel at one time point
